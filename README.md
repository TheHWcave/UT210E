# UT210E
If you have a UNT-T UT210E clamp meter, you may have wondered what the 3 trim pots inside the meter do and how they can be used to reduce the offset displayed by the meter when doing DC current measurements. 

Here you find the two procedures I show in the two videos on my YouTube channel TheHWcave

Note that the short procedure was developed and written by Dave whose YouTube channel is noakeswalker. He kindly permitted me to put his procedure on my Github page
